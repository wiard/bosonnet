# Bosonnet Architecture

## Overview
Bosonnet is an autonomous, decentralized network anchored to Bitcoin. It is designed to manage digital assets securely and transparently within the Bitmap ecosystem. The architecture is modular and composed of three primary layers, each responsible for distinct parts of the system’s functionality.

## Layered Architecture

### 1. User Interface Layer
- **Description**: This layer provides an interface for user interactions with Bosonnet, focusing on privacy and usability.
- **Main Components**:
  - `ui_layer.rs`: Core logic for user commands and interactions.
  - `observer.rs`: Manages privacy by selectively revealing data.
  - `api.rs`: Handles external API requests for interacting with Bosonnet.
- **Responsibilities**: Presents data, processes commands, and manages user access to features.

### 2. Bitcoin Core Layer
- **Description**: Interfaces directly with the Bitcoin blockchain, handling UTXO management, transaction validation, and consensus.
- **Main Components**:
  - `bitcoin_core.rs`: Manages the connection to Bitcoin and verifies transactions.
  - `utxo_manager.rs`: Manages UTXO-based transactions.
  - `consensus.rs`: Enforces consensus and finalizes transactions.
- **Responsibilities**: Ensures secure, valid transactions that align with Bitcoin’s consensus rules.

### 3. AI-driven Bitmap Layer
- **Description**: Manages parcel states and performs autonomous actions within the Bitmap ecosystem through intelligent agents.
- **Main Components**:
  - `bitmap_layer.rs`: Manages the states of parcels in the Bitmap network.
  - `ai_synchronizer.rs`: Coordinates synchronization and decision-making.
  - `parcel_state.rs`: Handles the state management and ownership of parcels.
  - `agent.rs`: Deploys AI agents for autonomous parcel management.
- **Responsibilities**: Provides autonomy in parcel management and adapts to user interactions dynamically.

## Data Flow and Inter-layer Communication
- **Data Flow**: Describes how data is passed between layers and components.
- **Communication**: Explains API endpoints, interfaces, and how the User Interface Layer communicates with the Bitcoin Core and Bitmap Layers to validate transactions and manage parcel states.

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Each layer operates independently with clear boundaries and APIs.
- **Security and Privacy**: Anchored on Bitcoin for security, with selective data reveal in the User Interface Layer.
- **Autonomy**: Autonomous decision-making in the Bitmap Layer through AI agents.
- **Extensibility**: Designed for future expansion and feature addition.

## Future Directions
- **Scaling**: Potential improvements for handling more complex user interactions or additional asset types.
- **Advanced AI**: Future capabilities for more sophisticated AI agents to enhance autonomous management.
